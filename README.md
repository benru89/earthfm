Earth.fm - funding reforestation projects by listening to nature

About
Earth.fm is a non-profit organisation that seeks to protect and regenerate natural ecosystems and reconnect us to the more-than-human world.

We're developing a platform to showcase rare natural soundscapes with the help of professional field recordists, turn them into gorgeous unique NFTs with the help of different artists, and auction them, using the money raised to support the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, empowering local communities and fighting climate change.
